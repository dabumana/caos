# Security Policy
### Repository Security Policy
#### 1. Introduction
This policy outlines the security measures and best practices to ensure the integrity and safety of our GitHub repository.
#### 2. Access Control
Collaborator Access: Only trusted individuals should be given collaborator access.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enforce the use of 2FA for all collaborators.
#### 3. Code Reviews
All changes must go through a pull request and be approved by at least one other collaborator before being merged into the main branch.
#### 4. Vulnerability Management
Regularly use automated security features like Dependabot alerts and security advisories to identify vulnerable dependencies.
Address identified vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
#### 5. Branch Protection
Protect the main branch to prevent direct pushes.
Require status checks to pass before merging pull requests.
#### 6. Secret Management
Never commit sensitive data, like passwords or API keys, directly into the repository.
Use GitHub secrets or environment variables for storing sensitive data.
#### 7. Incident Response
Have a plan in place for responding to security incidents, such as a detected breach or vulnerability.
#### 8. Training and Awareness
Ensure all collaborators are aware of this policy and have basic security awareness training.
Remember, this is just a basic outline. Depending on the specifics of your project, you may need to add or modify sections. Itâ€™s always a good idea to consult with a security professional when creating a security policy.
